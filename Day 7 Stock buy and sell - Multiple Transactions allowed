The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get.

Note: A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously and multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day.
